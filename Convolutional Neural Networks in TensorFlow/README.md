# Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow  

#### Exercise 1: Cats vs. Dogs  
A CNN model was used to classify images as being either a cat or a dog.  Two folders containg images of either cats or dogs were divided into training and validation subfolders.

#### Exercise 2: Cats vs. Dogs Using Augmentation  
Data augmentation was used in the ImageDataGenerator function to essentially create a larger training set in order to avoid overfitting the training set.  This improved validation losses.
