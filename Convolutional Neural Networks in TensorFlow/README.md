A CNN model was used to classify images as being either a cat or a dog.  Two folders containg images of either cats or dogs were divided into training and validation subfolders.

[Exercise 2: Cats vs. Dogs Using Augmentation](https://github.com/jeff-daniels/Coursera-TensorFlow-in-Practice/blob/master/Convolutional%20Neural%20Networks%20in%20TensorFlow/Exercise%202%20Cats%20vs%20Dogs%20using%20augmentation.ipynb)  
Data augmentation was used in the ImageDataGenerator function to essentially create a larger training set in order to avoid overfitting the training set.  This improved validation losses.

The Inception V3 model was used in a transfer learning application.  The pretrained model was left untrained and a trainable layers were added at the output of the second to last convolutional layer.  Dropout was also applied to the trainable layers to avoid overfitting and also made the validation accuracy higher thant the training accuracy.
