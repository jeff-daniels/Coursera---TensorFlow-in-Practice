# Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning  
This course was focused on how to use the Keras API and Tensorflow to solve deep learning problems.  This directory holds all of the exercise that were graded.  Most of the exercises were built around image classification applications.  Below each exercise are links to example notebooks that were used to teach the concepts used in the exercises.

#### Exercise 1: Housing Prices: 
A one layer neural network was used to predict housing prices.  This was essentially a linear regression.

#### Exercise 2: Handwriting Recognition:  
The MNIST dataset of handwritten numerical digits was used to train a simple model to classify what number each image represented. A callback was used to stop training after a certain accuracy was reached.

#### Exercise 3: Improve MNIST with Convolutions:  
A model was created with convolutional and pooling layers to identify MNIST numbers.

#### Exercise 4: Handling Complex Images:  
Images of happy or sad people were used to train a convolutional network.
