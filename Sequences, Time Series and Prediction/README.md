# Sequences, Time Series and Prediction  
## Exercise 1-Create and Predict Synthetic Data  
A time series was created and features trend, seasonality and noise.  A naive prediction of the time series was made simply by predicting the next point to be equal to the last point.  Mean squared error and mean average error were used to measure prediction performance.  By performing various operations on the data, a prediction that was better than the naive prediction was made.
